This program simulates a car driving down a three
lane road. It is possible to change lanes and move
up or fall back. The road also simulates other cars
and traffic lights.

To run the program simply enter make and the ./roadSim.

To clean the directory type make clean. make clear gets
rid of the object files as well.
